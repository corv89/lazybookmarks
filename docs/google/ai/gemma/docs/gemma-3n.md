Gemma 3n is a generative AI model optimized for use in everyday devices, such as phones, laptops, and tablets. This model includes innovations in parameter-efficient processing, including Per-Layer Embedding (PLE) parameter caching and a MatFormer model architecture that provides the flexibility to reduce compute and memory requirements. These models feature audio input handling, as well as text and visual data.

Gemma 3n includes the following key features:

-   **Audio input**: Process sound data for speech recognition, translation, and audio data analysis. [Learn more](/gemma/docs/core/huggingface_inference#audio)
-   **Visual and text input**: Multimodal capabilities let you handle vision, sound, and text to help you understand and analyze the world around you. [Learn more](/gemma/docs/core/huggingface_inference#vision)
-   **Vision encoder:** High-performance MobileNet-V5 encoder substantially improves speed and accuracy of processing visual data. [Learn more](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/introducing-gemma-3n-developer-guide/#mobilenet-v5:-new-state-of-the-art-vision-encoder)
-   **PLE caching**: Per-Layer Embedding (PLE) parameters contained in these models can be cached to fast, local storage to reduce model memory run costs. [Learn more](#ple-caching)
-   **MatFormer architecture:** Matryoshka Transformer architecture allows for selective activation of the models parameters per request to reduce compute cost and response times. [Learn more](#matformer)
-   **Conditional parameter loading:** Bypass loading of vision and audio parameters in the model to reduce the total number of loaded parameters and save memory resources. [Learn more](#conditional-parameter)
-   **Wide language support**: Wide linguistic capabilities, trained in over 140 languages.
-   **32K token context**: Substantial input context for analyzing data and handling processing tasks.

## Model parameters and effective parameters

Gemma 3n models are listed with parameter counts, such as **`E2B`** and **`E4B`**, that are *lower* than the total number of parameters contained in the models. The **`E`** prefix indicates these models can operate with a reduced set of Effective parameters. This reduced parameter operation can be achieved using the flexible parameter technology built into Gemma 3n models to help them run efficiently on lower resource devices.

The parameters in Gemma 3n models are divided into 4 main groups: text, visual, audio, and per-layer embedding (PLE) parameters. With standard execution of the E2B model, over 5 billion parameters are loaded when executing the model. However, using parameter skipping and PLE caching techniques, this model can be operated with an effective memory load of just under 2 billion (1.91B) parameters, as illustrated in Figure 1.

**Figure 1.** Gemma 3n E2B model parameters running in standard execution versus an effectively lower parameter load using PLE caching and parameter skipping techniques.

Using these parameter offloading and selective activation techniques, you can run the model with a very lean set of parameters or activate additional parameters to handle other data types such as visual and audio. These features enable you to ramp up model functionality or ramp down capabilities based on device capabilities or  requirements. The following sections explain more about the parameter efficient techniques available in Gemma 3n models.

## PLE caching

Gemma 3n models include Per-Layer Embedding (PLE) parameters that are used during model execution to create data that enhances the performance of each model layer. The PLE data can be generated separately, outside the operating memory of the model, cached to fast storage, and then added to the model inference process as each layer runs. This approach allows PLE parameters to be kept out of the model memory space, reducing resource consumption while still improving model response quality.

## MatFormer architecture

Gemma 3n models use a Matryoshka Transformer or *MatFormer* model architecture that contains nested, smaller models within a single, larger model. The nested sub-models can be used for inferences without activating the parameters of the enclosing models when responding to requests. This ability to run just the smaller, core models within a MatFormer model can reduce compute cost, and response time, and energy footprint for the model. In the case of Gemma 3n, the E4B model contains the parameters of the E2B model. This architecture also lets you select parameters and assemble models in intermediate sizes between 2B and 4B. For more details on this approach, see the [MatFormer research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07707). Try using MatFormer techniques to reduce the size of a Gemma 3n model with the [MatFormer Lab](https://goo.gle/gemma3n-matformer-lab) guide.

## Conditional parameter loading

Similar to PLE parameters, you can skip loading of some parameters into memory, such as audio or visual parameters, in the Gemma 3n model to reduce memory load. These parameters can be dynamically loaded at runtime if the device has the required resources. Overall, parameter skipping can further reduce the required operating memory for a Gemma 3n model, enabling execution on a wider range of devices and allowing developers to increase resource efficiency for less demanding tasks.
